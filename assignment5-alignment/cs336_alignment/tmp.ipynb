The smallest odd number greater than 46 is 47, and the largest odd number less than 64 is 63. So, the sequence of odd numbers is 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, and 63.\\n\\nNext, we need to calculate the sum of these numbers. We notice that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence (arithmetic progression) with the first term \\\\(a = 47\\\\) and the last term \\\\(l = 63\\\\). The common difference \\\\(d = 2\\\\).\\n\\nTo find the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we use the formula: \\n\\\\( S_n = \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\times (a + l) \\\\),\\nwhere \\\\(n\\\\) is the number of terms.\\n\\nWe can find \\\\(n\\\\) by using the formula for the \\\\(n\\\\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:\\n\\\\( l = a + (n-1) \\\\times d \\\\).\\n\\nSo,\\n\\\\[ 63 = 47 + (n-1) \\\\times 2 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 63 - 47 = (n-1) \\\\times 2 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 16 = (n-1) \\\\times 2 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ n-1 = 8 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ n = 9 \\\\]\\n\\nNow, substituting back into the sum formula:\\n\\\\[ S_9 = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\times (47 + 63) \\\\]\\n\\\\[ S_9 = \\\\frac{9}{2} \\\\times 110 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ S_9 = \\\\frac{9 \\\\times 110}{2} \\\\]\\n\\\\[ S_9 = 9 \\\\times 55 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ S_9 = 495 \\\\]\\n\\nThus, the sum of the odd integers between 46 and 64 is 495. </think> <answer>495</answer>'}\n"
